Excerpts
From [An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, Book IV, Chap. 2](https://www.econlib.org/library/Smith/smWN.html?chapter_num=27#book-reader) by Adam Smith. London: Methuen and Co., Ltd., 1904. Edwin Cannan, ed. First published 1776.

> But the annual revenue of every society is always precisely equal to the exchangeable value of the whole annual produce of its industry, or rather is precisely the same thing with that exchangeable value.
> As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce may be of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can.
>
> He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it.
> By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, **led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention.**
> Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it.
> By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it.
>
> I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good. It is an affectation, indeed, not very common among merchants, and very few words need be employed in dissuading them from it. [Par. IV.2.9]

社会的年收入，总是等于全部年产物的交换价值，甚至可以说，它们其实是同一个东西。
所以，当商人们都尽力将其资本投在国内产业上，并通过细心管理来使生产物达到最高的交换价值时，社会的年收入自然会随之增加。

商人们的初衷，的确不是增加公共利益。所以，就连他自己在客观上增加了公共利益，他也不知道。
他所考虑的，只是自己的安全，所以他宁愿将资本投在国内产业上，也不支持国外产业。还是出于自身利益的考虑，他采取了可能使其生产物达到最高交换价值的管理方式。他在自身利益这只看不见的手的指导之下，为达到一个并非他本意想要达到的目的而努力着。
不过，虽然商人的行为不是出于本意，但也不能因此就说这一行为对社会有害。虽然商人的本意是追求自身利益，但他在追求自身利益的过程中，却为社会带来了更多的利益。

有些人虽说是为公众幸福才从事商业的，但我从未听说他们做了什么好事。幸好这种装腔作势的商人并不多见，所以我们也用不着理会他们。

Micro is that people, individual actors are acting out of their own self-interest.
And the macro is that it might be good for the economy, or the nation as a whole.
And so, now, modern economists tend to divide themselves into these two schools, or into these two subjects: microeconomics, which is the study of individual actors.
Microeconomics .. and those actors could be firms, could be people, it could be households.
And you have macro-economics, which is the study of the economy in aggregate.


And so, micro-economics is essentially how actors make decisions or, you could actually say decisions or allocations of scarce resources. And you hear the words scarce resources a lot when people talk about economics.
And a scarce resource is one you don't have an infinite amount of.
For example, love might not be a scarce resource. You might have an infinite amount of love.
But a resource that would be scarce is something like food, or water, or money, or time, or labor.
These are all scarce resources.
And so microeconomics is how do people decide where to put those scarce resource, how do they decide where to deploy them.
And how does that affect prices and markets, and whatever else.

Macro-economics is the study of what happens at the aggregate to an economy.
So, 'aggregate', what happens in aggregate to an economy, from the millions of individual actors.
Aggregate economy. We now have millions of actors.
And often focuses on policy-related questions.
SO, do you raise or lower taxes. Or, what's going to happen when you raise or lower taxes.
Do you regulate or de-regulate? How does that affect the overall productivity when you do this. So, it's policy, top-down .. 'top-down' questions.

And in both macro- and micro-economics, there is especially in the modern sense of it, there is an attempt to make them rigorous, to make them mathematical.

...

So, then you have a proper grain of salt, so that you are always focused on the true intuition.
And that's really the most important thing to get from a course on economics.
So you can truly reason through what's likely to happen, maybe even without the mathematics.
I'll leave you with two quotes. And thse quotes are a little bit .. a little bit funny, but they're really I think helpful things to keep in mind,
especially when you go deep into the mathematical side of economics.

So, this right over here is a quote by Aflred Knopf, who was publisher in the 1900s.
"An economist is a man who states the obvious in terms of the incomprehensible."

...

And then you have this quote here by Lawrence J. Peter, most famous for Peter's Principals, a professor at USC.
"An economist is an expert know will know tomorrow why the things he predicted yesterday didn't happen today."

And once again -- important to keep in the back of one's mind, because especially relevant to macro-economics, because in macro-economics
there is always all sorts of prediction about the state of the economy:
about what need to be done, about how long the recession will last, what will be the economic growth next year, what will inflation do ... and they often prove to be wrong.
In fact, few economists even tend to agree on many of these things.
And it's very important to realize that, because oftentimes when you are deep in the mathematics, economics might seem to be a science, like physics, but it's not a science like physics. It is open to subjectivity, and a lot of that subjectivity is all around the assumptions that you choose to make.
